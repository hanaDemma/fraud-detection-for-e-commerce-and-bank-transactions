# Fraud-detection-for-e-commerce-and-bank-transactions

## Overview

Fraud detection is a critical component for securing financial transactions in both e-commerce and banking sectors. At Adey Innovations Inc.,  aims to improve fraud detection by leveraging advanced machine learning models, geolocation analysis, and transaction pattern recognition. The project focuses on handling the unique challenges of both e-commerce and bank credit transactions, enabling more accurate and efficient detection of fraudulent activities.
