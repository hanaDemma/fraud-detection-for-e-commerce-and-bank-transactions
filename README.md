# Fraud-detection-for-e-commerce-and-bank-transactions

## Project Overview

Fraud detection is essential for securing financial transactions in e-commerce and banking. This project aims to enhance fraud detection by leveraging machine learning techniques, geolocation analysis, and transaction pattern recognition to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

## Features

**Data Analysis & Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming transaction data for fraud detection.
**Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful insights such as transaction frequency, velocity, and time-based patterns.
**Machine Learning Models**: Training and evaluating models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and more.
**Geolocation Analysis**: Mapping IP addresses to countries to detect fraud patterns.
**Model Deployment**: Using Flask APIs & Docker for real-time fraud detection.
**Dashboard Visualization**: Implementing Dash to visualize fraud trends and insights.
