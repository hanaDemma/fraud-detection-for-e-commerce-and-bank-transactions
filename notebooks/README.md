###  Task 1 - Data Analysis and Preprocessing
## Overview
The goal of this task is to prepare and refine the dataset for effective fraud detection. Proper data preprocessing ensures high-quality input for machine learning models, leading to improved accuracy and reliability. This involves handling missing values, cleaning data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), merging datasets for geolocation analysis, and extracting key features. Additionally, normalization, scaling, and encoding categorical features will be applied to ensure consistency and efficiency in model training.

## Steps:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputing or removing missing data to maintain dataset integrity.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates and correcting data types to ensure accuracy.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performing univariate and bivariate analysis to identify patterns and relationships.
- **Geolocation Analysis**: Converting IP addresses into integer format and merging fraud transaction data with geolocation data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting insights like transaction frequency, velocity, and time-based features (e.g., hour of the day, day of the week).
- **Normalization & Scaling**: Standardizing numerical features for better model performance.
- **Encoding Categorical Features**: Converting categorical data into numerical format for machine learning algorithms.

# Task-2 Model Building and Training 

## Overview
In this phase, the objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying fraudulent activities. The process includes:
## Steps:

1. Data Preparation:
- **Feature and Target Separation**:
    - Separate the features (independent variables) from the target variable (dependent variable).
    - In the 'creditcard' dataset, the target variable is labeled as 'Class'.
    - In the 'Fraud_Data' dataset, the target variable is labeled as 'class'.

- **Train-Test Split**:
    - Divide the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance.

2. Model Selection:
   - **To compare the performance of various models, consider the following algorithms**:
        - Logistic Regression
        - Decision Tree
        - Random Forest
        - Gradient Boosting
        - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
        - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
        - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
        - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

    - **Model Training and Evaluation**:
        - Training:
            - Train each selected model on the training dataset.
        - Evaluation:
            - Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
